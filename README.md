##  Machine Learning Models Used

| Model                | Description                                      |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Linear Regression    | Used with threshold for binary classification    |
| Logistic Regression  | Predicts probability of high income              |
| K-Nearest Neighbors  | Classifies based on closest data points          |
| Naive Bayes          | Probabilistic model based on feature independence|
| Random Forest        | Ensemble model using decision trees              |

##  Model Performance

Model accuracy was evaluated using standard test/train split and accuracy metrics:

 ##  Models Applied & Accuracy

The following models were trained and evaluated. Accuracy scores were calculated using a standard 80/20 train-test split:

| Model                | Accuracy |
